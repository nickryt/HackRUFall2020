# passpal
This is a solo project that I created for Hack RU Fall 2020, Rutgers' 24 hour coding competition.
It is a very simply password manager that allows the user to encrypt their usernames and passwords for a list of accounts and save their data with no strings attached.
Though the event is over I still maintain this project, as it is a piece that I actually use and trust to hold my passwords!

## WHAT I LEARNED :
- More Advanced Python
- Cryptography Functionality (Fernet API)
- Tkinter (GUI Design In Python)
